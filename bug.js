This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses a library that's not compatible with Expo Go.  Specifically, the app tries to use a native module that Expo Go doesn't support. The error message isn't always clear but might involve warnings about missing modules or native dependencies.

Example (using a hypothetical native module 'react-native-uncommon-module'):

```javascript
import UncommonModule from 'react-native-uncommon-module';

// ...rest of the app code using UncommonModule...
```
