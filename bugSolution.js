To fix this, you need to either:

1. **Replace the native module with an Expo-compatible alternative:**  Search for an equivalent module that works within the Expo ecosystem. Many popular libraries have Expo-compatible versions.

2. **Eject from Expo and build a standalone app:**  If an alternative is unavailable, you'll have to eject from the Expo managed workflow and build a standalone app using React Native directly.  This gives you complete control but requires a more complex build process.

3. **Use EAS Build:**  Expo's EAS Build provides a way to build and deploy standalone apps without ejecting, allowing you to test the app on physical devices or emulators.  This provides a better balance between ease of use and capability to include native modules.

Example solution (using a hypothetical Expo-compatible module):

```javascript
import ExpoCompatibleModule from 'expo-compatible-module'; // Replace with actual Expo module

// ...rest of the app code using ExpoCompatibleModule...
```

**Note:**  Always check the documentation of your native modules to confirm their compatibility with Expo and Expo Go.
